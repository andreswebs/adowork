# MVP Implementation Report: adowork CLI

**Date:** July 29, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the MVP for the `adowork` CLI tool, which enables users to create Azure DevOps work items from the command line.

## Key Features Implemented

- Command-line interface using `urfave/cli` v3
- Required flags for work item type and title, with aliases for usability
- Optional flags for description, assigned-to, parent, and dry-run
- Unified error handling via a custom `handleError` function
- Azure DevOps integration using the official Go SDK
- Dry-run mode for safe payload preview
- Validation of work item types against common Azure DevOps types

## Development Process

- Followed a task-driven workflow using Taskmaster
- Tasks and subtasks were tracked, expanded, and iteratively implemented
- All pending tasks were cancelled at MVP wrap-up to mark project completion
- Code and CLI usability were improved based on best practices and urfave/cli documentation

## Notable Decisions

- Required flags (`type`, `title`) ensure essential data is always provided
- Aliases added for all flags to streamline CLI usage
- Error handling is consistent and user-friendly, with no sensitive data leakage
- MVP scope focused on core functionality and reliability

## Next Steps / Recommendations

- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for error handling and CLI output
- Expand documentation, including troubleshooting and advanced usage
- Consider user feedback for future enhancements
